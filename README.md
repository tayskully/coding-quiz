# coding-quiz!
## A quiz to text your knowledge 

This quiz was created to test your knowledge of javaScript vanilla. 
This tool will help you study harder than ever before. 
Once you're finished, you should pat yourself on the back.

## Usage
Please visit my [Site!](https://tayskully.github.io/coding-quiz/)
In order to get the full experience, users must first click the "Start Quiz" button in order to prompt timer, and let the game begin. Once the game has begun, the user must choose their answer wisely! If you guess wrong, the timer will deduct 10 seconds of time. The buttons should turn black when hovered over, and will light up green for correct, or red for incorrect. 
When the game is over, peep your score! If you'd like to add it to the highscore board, enter your initals and the game will save them.
